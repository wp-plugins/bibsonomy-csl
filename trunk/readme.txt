== Description ==

Plugin to create publication lists based on the Citation Style Language (CSL). Allows direct integration with the 
social bookmarking and publication sharing system BibSonomy (http://www.bibsonomy.org) or PUMA (http://www.academic-puma.de). 
 
BibSonomy is a social bookmarking and publication-sharing system. It integrates the features of bookmarking 
systems with team-oriented publication management. BibSonomy offers its users the ability to store and organize 
their bookmarks and publications online and it supports the integration of scientific communities through user groups as well as the collection, management, exchange, export and display of literature lists.

With this plugin you have the possibility to render a list of publications, which you can select by different content types like
user and group. 

In addition you can filter the list, by using tags or free text search. So it's possible to render your own 
publications by selecting your own BibSonomy user and filtering the list with the tag 'myown'. It's also easily possible to integrate
your BibSonomy Tag Cloud.

To use this plugin, you need your BibSonomy user name and API key.
